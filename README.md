# Accidents
I worked on a project where I analyzed accidents using R. I got the data set of the accidents from ICPSR which is part of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. There are a lot of variables in the data set. I got rid of a lot of variables because I thought that they were not very useful. The variables that I analyzed were arguments, crime, drugs, fights, if the accident happened on the job, body part, the diagnosis, displacement, sex of the victim, firearms, location of the accident, transportation, the class of the accident, the age of the victim in the accident, the age group, the body part group, location of the accident group, race of the the person involved in the accident, if the person in the accident was Hispanic or not, the group of who caused the accident, and the year in which the accident occurred. I made a lot of graphs and histograms of the variables. Some of the graphs and histograms that I had were complex. I also did some filtering for some of the graphs as well. I also ran several chi-square tests of the data as well.
